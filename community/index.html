It also includes individuals and organizations located nearby whose lives and livelihoods are intertwined with the activities on Market Street, as well as the thousands each day who traverse the street on their way to other destinations.

		<h2>Input To Date</h2>
		<br>Market Street constituents have been engaged in conversations about the future of Market Street for  the past several years through the <a href="http://bettermarketstreetsf.org" target="_blank">Better Market Street</a> initiative, a planning collaboration involving several city departments. 
		<br><br>Throughout this process, the public has voiced the strong desire for a vibrant public realm on the sidewalks of Market Street, which gave birth to the  City’s proposal to create extra wide sidewalks animated as “street life districts.” This, in turn, catalyzed the idea of this festival and the specific design goals listed in the Open Call.

	<div class="col-md-6">
		<h2>Festival Process</h2>
		<br>We are committed to continuing this dialogue by cultivating a rich and ongoing conversation between Festival organizers, prototype designers and community members.

   		<br>The civic heart of the City, this district is known for its statuesque landmarks and destinations including the Civic Center, United Nations Plaza, the San Francisco Main Library, the Federal Building, and the various arts/cultural destinations that exist around the Civic Center on and off Market Street. <br><br>With new, luxury residential condos and office complexes for tech companies joining the mix of lower income and homeless residents, this district is defined by flux and a growing concern by many about gentrification.

   		<br>The face of the Tenderloin on Market Street, this district is experiencing the most dynamic changes of all of the Market Street districts. It is home to an array of artistic and cultural places, performance venues, public spaces, housing and a noticeable civic presence.<br><br>Historic places like the Orpheum and the Warfield are reminders of the prior history and identity of this segment of Market Street as an entertainment district while plans are underway to bring this identity back to life.  At the same time tech and other successful companies are moving in, the neighboring Tenderloin is rich with immigrant culture as well as the youngest and poorest populations of the city.

   		<br>With a rich maritime history, the waterfront terminus of Market Street is celebrated by bringing urban activity to the water, and bringing the unique character of the Ferry Building and water’s
edge back to the city.<br><br>The tall commercial buildings of the Financial District give way
to plazas, parks and urban recreation along the waterfront,  inviting tourists and locals alike to experience the bustling Ferry Building, which opened in 1898 as the wooden Ferry House,  the focal point for anyone arriving by train from the East, or workers coming to the city by ferry from Marin or the East Bay. Today the ferry building is not only a transportation hub,  but is a farm-to-table, and made-in-San Francisco marketplace.

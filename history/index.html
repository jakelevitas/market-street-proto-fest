		The Market Street Prototyping Festival builds upon a five-year, multi-agency effort for a Better Market Street to re-establish San Franciscoâ€™s civic backbone as a place to stop and spend time, meet friends, people watch, or just stroll and experience the scenery.

	The 2015 Festival marks the return of Urban Prototyping to San Francisco, whose historic foray into civic innovation in the built environment includes widely acclaimed experiments and initiatives such as its <a href="http://pavementtoparks.sfplanning.org/parklets.html" target="_blank">Parklet Program</a> and <a href="http://liz.innovatesf.com" target="_blank">Living Innovation Zones</a>. 
	<br><br>
	Urban Prototyping Festival is a pioneering program of citizen engagement in urban design developed in 2012 by San Francisco nonprofits <a href="http://grayarea.org" target="_blank">Gray Area Foundation for the Arts</a> and <a href="http://theintersection.org" target="_blank">Intersection for the Arts</a>.

	The widely acclaimed festival led to the development of very diverse projects such as <a href="http://www.georgezisiadis.com/#/pulse-of-the-city/" target="_blank">Pulse of the City</a>, <a href="http://pplanter.com/" target="_blank">PPLanter</a>, and Urban Parasol that have since then been adopted and deployed in multiple cities around the world. Following this success, Urban Prototyping has become a global movement spreading over 3 continents and engaging thousands of people in participating in the planning and design of their city.

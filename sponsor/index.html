		Our mission is to make Market Street more active, responsive, and inclusive by engaging the creativity of our communities and reflecting that on our streets.  Market Street Prototyping Festival provides a rare opportunity for your businesses or organization to align with a forward thinking approach to city design and civic participation.  
    <br><br>
    The Festival will reach <strong>more than 300,000 people</strong> on Market Street just three days.  Hundreds of thousands will touch, test, and experience the city’s most iconic street in a way never done before.  This is a monumental event for San Francisco and potentially for cities around the country.  
    <br><br>
    “The festival is a great example of collaboration between city agencies and civic innovators of all kinds,” said Carol Coletta, Knight Foundation’s vice president of community and national initiatives. “We hope to see some important ideas emerge from the festival, but most importantly to promote it as a model for cross-city learning and development.”
    <br><br>
    By joining us as a Sponsor of  Market Street Prototyping, your brand will receive widespread recognition as a champion of citizen-driven design initiatives on an unmatched public scale.  
    <br><br><h3>Audience + Impact</h3>
    Over the course of the next four months, your brand will connect with  our core community of design specialists, city planning experts, arts + culture professionals, and community leaders that represent a distinct audience of influence in San Francisco and beyond.  Estimated online impressions begin at <strong>over 1 million</strong> as press outlets, designers from around the world, and industry leaders keep up to date on the project teams’ progress and pre-festival events. 
    <br><br>
    Because this event is free and open to the public, in fact it is entirely driven by public participation, your brand will receive hundreds of thousands of physical impressions from all walks of life in just 3 days.  Our pre-Festival street engagement days are another way to gain brand recognition; project teams will take to the streets three times over the course of the summer to solicit direct audience feedback and participation. 
    <br><br>
    We have a tailored approach across multiple platforms for your brand’s recognition as a lead supporter of cross-sector collaboration in urban design.  From providing support to individual projects or sponsoring the detailed documentation of the process to becoming a high level Sponsor of the Festival, we are committed to working with you to design a sponsor package that directly aligns with your brand’s priorities.
